A serious and mini swift langchain copy, for ios or mac apps.


## Setup
1. Create env.txt file in main project.
2. Set some var like OPENAI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_BASE

Like this.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
OPENAI_API_BASE=xxx
SUPABASE_URL=xxx
SUPABASE_KEY=xxx
```

### Support env var
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_BASE
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_KEY
